NOTES
1. Earth rotates at roughly a Day/Frame at fastest, and a Day/Second at slowest. Also the moon goes around Earth around 12 times per year, just like real life!
2. So, I don't have orbital or axial tilts because it's exam week and I don't have time to do this assignment anymore, even with a couple more late days. It's the kind of thing I'll probably return to during my break.
3. I also don't have an explicit scene graph that has a Sphere object or anything, but I tried to make it as "implicit" as possible. That counts, right?
4. Bonus for changing camera speed/focal planet? It's a pretty awesome feature :3
5. I have two Earth textures: one is high quality but has dark and moody colours. The other is bright but really low quality. I'm using the low quality as default since it's easier to see, so if Earth looks pixelated then at least the other texture is included.
6. I calculated distances using the formula: 2 * sqrt(log5(length)) +/- personal adjustments, since I tried using logs alone and it didn't look good. Then Sonny posted his correction on Piazza and I got confused so I decided to leave it alone.
